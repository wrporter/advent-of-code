## Day 24

### Part 1

My initial reaction was, "Ooo! Conway's Game of Life!!". Then I thought, "There's got to be some kind of trick, if not in part 1, undoubtedly in part 2." So I figured to start with a 2D grid of `byte`s then store each iteration in a flattened string form to conserve space and so I could index in a `map` for checking past iterations.
