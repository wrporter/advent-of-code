# Day 2

## Thoughts

A fun little puzzle that required a good amount of rules. This felt harder for day 2 than years past, but not bad.

### Part 1

Part 1 was a breeze, but I tripped over getting the logic right the first time.

### Part 2

I tried to be clever by optimizing, then threw out that plan and decided to loop through and find a safe version of the report after removing one item at a time. I figured it would be too difficult to find which number was not tolerable.

I then wasted several minutes on putting together a slice removal function that wouldn't modify the original. Then just decided to copy the report each time before modifying it.
