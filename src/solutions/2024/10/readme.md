# Day 10

### Part 1

I ran this with a BFS to find the 9s. The only nuance is we don't want duplicate 9s to count, so I store the locations in a set.

### Part 2

This one requires DFS so we can backtrack. I realized as soon as I finished that I could have used DFS for both parts and just excluded backtracking for Part 1.
