# Day 4

## Thoughts

There's probably a much better way to do this. I wrote my solution in a very straightforward way.

### Part 1

Nothing special. I just went through each character in the grid until finding an X. Then go in each direction to see if we have a word match.

### Part 2

Very similar to my Part 1 solution. Go until we find an A. Then see if SAM/MAS crosses it in both directions.
