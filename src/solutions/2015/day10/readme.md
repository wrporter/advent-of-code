## Day 10

### Part 1

For some reason, I kept stumbling on my process for tracking counts of digits. But then it dawned on me that we only really have to worry about if we hit the end and not the previous digit. So we just count the characters until the next one is different.

Once we've got our basic implementation, we just throw that in a for loop with the number of iterations.

### Part 2

Wow! We literally didn't have to do any extra work, just run it 10 iterations more.
