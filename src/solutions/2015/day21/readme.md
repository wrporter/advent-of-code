## Day 21

### Part 1

Throwing a game in there, how fun! I just had fun setting this one up with a shop and inventory. The trick to this one is running through permutations with the various item slots. I'm not sure if there's a better way than nesting the permutations. I wrote a generic permutation function after having done so many puzzles with permutations, which made the logic a lot easier.

We are ultimately able to win with the `Longsword`, `Chainmail`, and `Defense +1` ring! Woot!

### Part 2

For this one, we just need to invert our logic to get the max losing cost.
