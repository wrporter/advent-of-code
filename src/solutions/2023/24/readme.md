# Day 24

## Thoughts

What a day! This one was the only puzzle where I needed to take direct code from Reddit. Maybe because I am too exhausted to figure out any more puzzles and also because this seems like the most challenging one I've run into. It seems most people on the Reddit ran into similar problems and simply threw their input into a solver.

### Part 1

Because we are dealing with just the `x` and `y` axes, this really isn't too bad. We can use the most commonly known equations for line intersections. We just need to make sure to rule out lines that are running parallel to each other and lines that do intersect, but at a time before `t=0`.

### Part 2

I was completely and totally stumped on this one. I pulled the code directly from a post on Reddit, not wanting to install something like Z3, like most people mention.
