# Day 1

## Thoughts

I have been awaiting Advent of Code quite anxiously. So excited to get up early this morning to enjoy the first puzzles!

### Part 1

This one was a cakewalk, as day 1 normally is. Fun and easy to think through.

1. Loop through each line.
2. Use a for loop to find the first digit.
3. Reverse a for loop to find the last digit.
4. Concatenate the digits as strings and convert to a number, then add to the total sum.

### Part 2

Now this one was a doozy ðŸ˜…! Maybe there are better approaches, but I went for the dumb approach and created a map of all the numbers to their associated values. I did a quick manual check of the input to make sure there wasn't anything over 20 (as words).

1. Loop through each line.
2. Add all the found numbers to a map of locations. Make sure to get the first and last index in case there are duplicates.
3. Find the first and last numbers.
4. Make sure to get the first and last digit within those numbers in case there are teens to account for.
5. Concatenate the digits as strings and convert to a number, then add to the total sum.

Here's what tripped me up and discovered while debugging.

1. I didn't realize actual digits were still included. For example, `3` versus `three`. Make sure to read all the instructions!!!
2. I forgot to account for duplicates, so I did a second pass to get both the first and last occurrences of numbers.
3. To account for teens, there is an extra digit. When calculating my first and last digits, I had to make sure to split those out. **Edit:** The example input has `7pqrstsixteen`, so I thought for sure I'd have to account for teens. Looks like my input doesn't actually have `teen` anywhere in it. Well, that would have saved 10 minutes of debugging, but at least my solution is teen-proof ðŸ˜‚. **Edit 2:** There is ambiguity with teens, so maybe it's best to just stay out of the teen business altogether. For example, `sixteen` could result in `16` or `616` or just `6`, depending on the rules. I've removed my teen version to simplify the code.
