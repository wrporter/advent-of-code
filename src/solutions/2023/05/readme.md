# Day 5

## Thoughts

These problems seem to be harder this early than previous years. I was actually awake when the puzzle came out at 10pm due to an alert (I am on-call this week), but after I skimmed the problem description, I said, "Nope, not staying up any later for this. Way too many instructions to parse through without sleep."

I thought about the problem a bit just before jumping into bed and had a rough idea at a solution. I knew, though, that parsing the input was going to take most of my time.

### Part 1

And sure enough, parsing did take most of my time, but wasn't too bad.

1. Loop through each category map.
2. Loop through each seed.
3. Loop through each source/destination conversion and update the seed values. As noted in the instructions, if a seed does not match a range, its value remains the same, so we don't have to worry about modifying those.
4. My input followed the same pattern with `location` being the final category, so I didn't bother keeping track of categories. I then take the minimum seed value and return that as my result.

### Part 2

I knew I was going to have to do some range math. A brute force solution would mean keeping track of 2,207,992,798 seeds! I let the code run while I started working on a better algorithm, and it finished in 5 minutes 46 seconds! ðŸ˜…

Here's my brute force method, which took only a minute to write, then another few minutes to debug because I didn't read the instructions properly that the second values are the length and not the end of a range.

1. Create seeds for every value in the ranges.
2. Follow the steps from Part 1.

Overall, I was very lucky with my delta time between solving parts 1 and 2. Advent of Code shows it was 21m55s.

I'll commit the brute force solution now, with plans to return and clean things up.

#### Edit (performance improvement!)

Got some time to come back and think through the range math. 

1. Loop through each seed range.
2. Loop through each category map. Keep track of seed ranges that are fully contained within a category conversion. These are ranges we know matched a range and need no further processing.
3. Loop through each source/destination conversion and update the seed ranges. Keep track of ranges that need to be split and considered by other conversions.
4. Loop through the original seed range and any splits that we perform.
   1. Create ranges relative to the category conversion we are currently evaluating. We track before, within, and after the conversion source range.
   2. Only process valid ranges. The end of the range must be after the start of the range.
5. Set the current seed ranges to evaluate to any ranges that we split.
6. Once we are done processing a seed range, keep track of the minimum value from the start of the each range.
7. Return the minimum value from the processed ranges.
