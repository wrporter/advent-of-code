## Thoughts

What a tricky problem!

### Part 1

We can brute force with a bread-first search until we reach the number of steps.

### Part 2

This one required seeing patterns in the input again. Looking at the Reddit threads, the plots becomes a polynomial and we can solve for it by finding the first few points on the quadratic curve.

I wasn't able to make my Part 2 code work for the sample input. I kept trying, but was struggling to find the proper solution. I might come back to it to understand things more later.
