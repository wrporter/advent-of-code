## Day 11

### Part 1

This reminds me of Day 5, but with a few differences. The interesting part being that we need to figure out how to increment letter strings.

### Part 2

We just have to plug Santa's next password into our generator. These puzzles are far different from 2019, where many Part 2s don't require any extra work!
