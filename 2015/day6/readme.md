## Day 6

### Part 1

Ah, now this one looks more interesting, having to parse some instructions. I use a regex and store the values then act on each command `turn on`, `toggle`, and `turn off`. I started off with a fast approach and plan to clean it up with Part 2.

### Part 2

I reused code from Part 1, but I couldn't build on it without unnecessary complexity (like passing in a flag to tell whether it was brightness and only using integers versus booleans).
