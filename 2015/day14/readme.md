## Day 14

### Part 1

Really not too bad. Start with parsing the reindeer and their respective speeds. Then we just loop through every second and determine whether the reindeer has gone further or is resting.

### Part 2

Luckily, I kept track of the leader every second in Part 1, so all I had to do was keep track of a winner based on score. I feel bad for Blitzen though. He didn't even score a single point!
