## Day 20

### Part 1

I did not know an efficient algorithm for getting divisors of a number without looping through all numbers from 1 to our target value. So I looked that one up, but was on an okay track, I felt like. I just loop through all houses from 1 on up and calculate the number of presents delivered to each house. Once we reach a house that has at least as much as the puzzle input, we return that house number.
